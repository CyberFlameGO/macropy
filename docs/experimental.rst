Experimental Macros
===================

Below are a selection of macros which demonstrate the cooler aspects
of MacroPy, but are not currently stable or tested enough that we
would be comfortable using them in production code.

.. warning::

  Be aware that for what concerns MacroPy3, only :ref:`pattern` and
  :ref:`pinq` have received some love. If you like any of them please
  to not hesitate to contribute PRs or bug reports!
